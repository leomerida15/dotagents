# PRD: [Feature/Product Name]

> Product Requirements Document - Use this template for defining major features, user requirements, and success criteria.

## Problem Statement

What user problem are we solving?

Describe:
- Who is affected (user segment)
- What pain point exists
- Why solving this matters

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals (What we WILL achieve)
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

### Non-Goals (What we will NOT do - scope boundaries)
- [Non-goal 1]
